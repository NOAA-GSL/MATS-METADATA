# MATS-METADATA

place to keep iterations of mats metadata and index creation scripts.

## metadata

There is a GO routine that will use an environment variable to specify credentials for accessing a MATS Couchbase database.
The routine will retrive all of the static (non auto generated) metadata documents that are not station data (which is always generated but not be marked as generated).
These metadata documents are stored in individual files in the metadata directory that are named after the document id values.
These files are pushed to the development branch of the MATS-METADATA repo, if they are different
from what is already in the repo.

It is expected that someone is subscribed to that repo and watching for changes.

## indexes

There is a GO routine that will use an environment variable to specify credentials for accessing a MATS Couchbase database.
The routine will retrive all of the indexes currently defined on that database instance and stor them in a singele file in the indexes directory.
This file will be pushed to the development branch of the MATS-METADATA repo, if it differs from what is already there.
